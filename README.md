# ansible-junos-evpn-vxlan
Group of Ansible playbooks to generate IP Fabric + EVPN configuration.
For use in a private cloud DC in conjunction with Contrail Networking.  
Fabric design and use cases are covered in design.ppt

## Package Dependencies
**python**: Python 2.7.5  
**pip packages:**
ansible: 2.8.6  
jinja2: 2.10.3  

Ansible user should be created and public keys should be configured on all devices  
Complete packages list is available in hostRequirements.txt   

## Introduction
These ansible playbooks are designed to work in multi-site deployments.

Site specific variables should reside in ```inventory/{{site}}/group_vars/all/```  
All hosts to be configured should be specified in ```inventory/{{site}}/hosts.yml```  

Generated configuration for each device will be output to ```host_vars/{{site}}/{{inventory_hostname}}```

```host_vars/{{site}}/{{inventory_hostname}}/bakup/``` directory will contain all historical config generated by generate_ip_fabric.yml in previous runs.

**ansible.cfg** has the required master ansible configuration.
If you are running from within a python virtual environment you will need to add 
```ini
interpreter_python="/path/to/virtual_environment/bin/python"
```
to **ansible.cfg**

## Playbook execution
The playbooks are structured into roles.  
These roles can be executed individually to generate specific configuration segments.  
Alternatively the roles can be executed in a coordinated manner to generate entire configurations.

### Generating the complete configuration: 
i.e. executing all the roles
```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab" generate_ip_fabric.yml #here lab is dummy site so please use your site code accordingly 
```


### Generating specific configuration:
i.e. executing a specific role

Parameters to be passed:
-->rolename (name of role to be executed)

```shell
ansible-playbook generate_ip_fabric.yml -e "rolename=generate-overlay-vars" -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab"  #here lab is dummy site so please use your site code accordingly
```
**OR**
```shell
ansible-playbook generate_ip_fabric.yml --extra-vars "rolename=generate-overlay-vars" -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab" #here lab is dummy site so please use your site code accordingly
```

In the above example rolename is generate-overlay-vars

List of roles all individual roles:

- generate-p2p-ips
- generate-underlay-vars
- generate-underlay-ebgp
- generate-assembled-configuration

### Pushing the configuration
Once the configuration has been generated, it needs to be pushed to the network.

Pushing the generated configuration to all the hosts:
```shell
ansible-playbook final_config_push.yml -vvv -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab" , # here lab is dummy site so please use your site code accordingly
```

Pushing the generated configuration to a particular host device:
```shell
ansible-playbook final_config_push.yml -vvv --limit leaf-01 -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab" , #here lab is dummy site so please use your site code accordingly
```

### Dry run
It is possible to run ```final_config_push``` as a dry run to see what changes will be pushed without commiting the changes.  This pushes the configuration, performs a ```show| compare``` then performs a ```rollback``` and exists from the device.

```shell
ansible-playbook final_config_push.yml -vvv --check --diff -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab" , # here lab is dummy site so please use your site code accordingly
```

### Commit Confirm
Push with commit-confirm and commit-minutes for all hosts -- If the configuration is not pushed within the commit minutes time the configuration will be roled back.
Parameters to be passed:
->commit_confirm (yes or no)
->commit_minutes Ex(1,2)

```shell
ansible-playbook commit_confirm_push.yml -e "commit_confirm=yes commit_minutes=1" -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab" , #here lab is dummy site so please use your site code accordingly
```

Push with commit-confirm and commit-minutes for a particular host:
```shell
ansible-playbook commit_confirm_push.yml -e "commit_confirm=yes commit_minutes=1" --limit leaf-01 -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab" , #here lab is dummy site so please use your site codeaccordingly
```

### Fabric verfication  
This package also contains a playbook to run many verification tests on the fabric to ensure it is operational after configuration has been pushed.

```shell
ansible-playbook -i inventory/lab/hosts.yml -e "site=lab" check_ip_fabric.yml, #here lab is dummy site so please use your site codeaccordingly
```

```yaml
# check_ip_fabric.yml has following roles and plays 
  - name: check IP Fabric Interfaces Admin Status
    include_role:
      name: check-underlay-if
  - name: check ip reachability between underlay interfaces
    include_role:
      name: ping
  - name: check lldp for underlay interfaces
    include_role:
      name: check-lldp
  - name: check  IP Fabric ebgp & MP-iBGP
    include_role:
      name: check-bgp

```


### Collect CLI output
There is also a playbook to collect any arbitrary CLI output.

To collect Junos CLI output execute ```check_cli.yml``` playbook.   
The output to gather can be customised be modifiying ```inventory/{{site}}/group_vars/all/cli.yml```  
It includes following plays and roles
```yaml
- name: collect cli
  hosts: all
  connection: local
  gather_facts: false
  tasks:
  - name: inclued Juniper junos
    include_role:
      name: Juniper.junos
  - name: collect cli
    include_role:
      name: collect-commands
```
